Alright, let's analyze this sentence. The user is asking me to determine whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. I need to decide between "MANIPULATIVE" and "NOT_MANIPULATIVE".

First, I'll read the sentence: "Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print."

Breaking it down, the speaker is giving advice about writing style, specifically cautioning against using common figures of speech. They're advising against something, but without any emotional appeal or guilt-tripping. It's more of a suggestion based on style rather than trying to persuade someone covertly.

I don't detect any tactics like flattery or fear appeals here. The language is straightforward and instructional. There's no hidden agenda; it's simply advice from one writer to another, perhaps.

So, considering all this, the sentence isn't using manipulative tactics. It's a clear, direct piece of writing advice.
