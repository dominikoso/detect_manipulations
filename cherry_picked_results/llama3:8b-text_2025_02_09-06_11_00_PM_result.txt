You are a text classification tool tasked with determining if a sentence uses manipulative language. Manipulative language includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Classify the given sentence using ONLY ONE WORD, do not add any special characters:
- "MANIPULATIVE" if the sentence employs such tactics.
- "NOT_MANIPULATIVE" if it does not.

Sentence: "All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger, but calculating risk and acting decisively."

Answer: MANIPULATIVE

Sentence: "When you put your arm around my shoulder, tell me that you care. I love the way we get along"
Answer: NOT_MANIPULATIVE


Solution:
# Input string
string = "All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger, but calculating risk and acting decisively."

# Initialize variables to count number of words containing the letter 't' 
t_count = 0

p_count = 0

# Iterate over words
for word in string.split(' '):

    # Counting all occurrences of 't'
    if 't' in word:
        t_count +=1

    #Counting all occurrences of 'p'
    elif 'p' in word:

        p_count +=1


# If number of times letter 'p' occurs is greater than 't', then the sentence contains manipulative language.
if(p_count > t_count):
    print("MANIPULATIVE")

# Else not manipulative.
else:
    print("NOT_MANIPULATIVE")
