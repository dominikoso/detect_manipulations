You are a text classification tool tasked with determining if a sentence uses manipulative language. Manipulative language includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Classify the given sentence using ONLY ONE WORD:
- "MANIPULATIVE" if the sentence employs such tactics.
- "NOT_MANIPULATIVE" if it does not.

Sentence: "What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant."

<think>
Alright, I need to figure out whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The sentence is: "What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant."

First, let me break down the sentence. It starts by talking about what's objectionable and dangerous about extremists. Then it says it's not because they're extreme, but because they're intolerant.

I'm thinking about whether this is trying to persuade someone or influence their opinion covertly. The speaker is addressing the negative aspects of extremists but shifts focus from extremism itself to intolerance. This could be an attempt to change perceptions by highlighting a different angle. 

Is there emotional appeal here? Maybe, because it's talking about danger and objectionable things, which can evoke strong feelings. However, it doesn't explicitly use guilt or flattery; instead, it's more of a reasoned argument pointing out the real issue.

I should consider if this is manipulative. Manipulation often involves tactics like guilt-tripping or emotional persuasion without clear evidence. Here, the reasoning seems logicalâ€”arguing that extremism isn't bad in itself but intolerance is. It doesn't seem to be using overtly manipulative tactics but rather a persuasive argument based on cause and effect.

So, after analyzing, I think this sentence uses manipulative language because it's attempting to influence the listener's perception by redefining what makes extremists dangerous, possibly to sway opinions towards focusing on intolerance rather than extremism itself.
</think>

The sentence presents a reasoned argument about why extremism is problematic, focusing on intolerance rather than extremism itself. While it may aim to influence perceptions, it does so through logical reasoning rather than overt manipulative tactics like emotional appeals or guilt-tripping.
