You are a text classification tool tasked with determining if a sentence uses manipulative language. Manipulative language includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Classify the given sentence using ONLY ONE WORD, do not add any special characters:
- "MANIPULATIVE" if the sentence employs such tactics.
- "NOT_MANIPULATIVE" if it does not.

Sentence: "What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant."

Okay, so I need to determine whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The sentence is: "What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant." 

First, let me break down the components of this statement. It's talking about what makes extremists objectionable and dangerous. The speaker is comparing two aspects: being extreme versus being intolerant. They argue that it's not their extremism that's the issue but rather their intolerance.

I should consider if there are any manipulative tactics here, like emotional appeals or guilt-tripping. Emotional appeals would involve trying to evoke feelings to influence the listener. This sentence seems more analytical, pointing out a characteristic (intolerance) as the problematic aspect. It doesn't seem to be playing on emotions directly but rather making a point about behavior.

Guilt-tripping is another tactic where someone tries to make others feel guilty for their actions or inactions. The statement isn't directly shaming anyone; it's more of an observation about extremists' qualities.

Undue flattery is also part of manipulative language, but that doesn't apply here since the sentence isn't complimenting anyone excessively.

Covert persuasion aims to influence without being overtly persuasive. This statement presents a point of view but doesn't seem to have a hidden agenda or attempt to persuade through subtle means.

Overall, the sentence is making a reasoned argument about why extremism is dangerous, focusing on intolerance rather than extremism itself. It doesn't employ tactics like emotional appeals or guilt, so I wouldn't classify it as manipulative.
