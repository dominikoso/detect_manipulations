You are a text classification tool tasked with determining if a sentence uses manipulative language. Manipulative language includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Classify the given sentence using ONLY ONE WORD, do not add any special characters:
- "MANIPULATIVE" if the sentence employs such tactics.
- "NOT_MANIPULATIVE" if it does not.

Sentence: "Suppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were a member of Congress; but I repeat myself."

Alright, so I need to figure out whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The sentence is: "Suppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were a member of Congress; but I repeat myself."

First, I should understand what manipulative language entails. From the description, it includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Looking at the sentence, it starts with two hypothetical scenarios: "Suppose you were an idiot" and "and suppose you were a member of Congress." Then it ends with "but I repeat myself."

I'm trying to see if there's any emotional appeal here. The first part seems like it's making fun of someone by suggesting they might be both an idiot and a Congressman, which could be seen as insulting or sarcastic. However, sarcasm can sometimes be manipulative because it's intended to mock or persuade without being direct.

Is the speaker trying to influence the listener's opinions or behavior? It seems like they're making a point about Congress members perhaps acting foolishly, but it's more of a statement than a direct attempt to persuade someone. There's no overt flattery or guilt-tripping; instead, there's a bit of mockery.

The last part, "but I repeat myself," might be a way to acknowledge the redundancy in their statement, which doesn't add manipulative elements but rather clarifies their intent.

So, considering all this, while the sentence is critical and perhaps sarcastic, it doesn't employ overt manipulative tactics like guilt-tripping or emotional appeals. It's more of a pointed critique than an attempt to covertly persuade.
