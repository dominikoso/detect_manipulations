Okay, so I need to figure out whether the sentence "No citizen is apolitical; as a citizen, by definition, has to take interest in public affairs." uses manipulative language. The classification should be either MANIPULATIVE or NOT_MANIPULATIVE.

First, let me break down what manipulative language entails. It includes things like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any subtle persuasion aimed at influencing someone's behavior or opinions. So I'm looking for tactics that try to push the reader into thinking a certain way without providing solid evidence or logical arguments.

Looking at the sentence: "No citizen is apolitical; as a citizen, by definition, has to take interest in public affairs." 

The first part says no citizen is apolitical. That's a strong statement, implying that all citizens have some political stance or involvement. The second part uses a definition argument: "as a citizen, by definition..." This suggests that taking interest in public affairs is inherent in the role of being a citizen.

I don't immediately see any emotional appeals here; it seems more like a definitional assertion rather than an attempt to stir emotions. There's no guilt-tripping involved because it's not blaming or shaming anyone for not being interested. Also, there's no undue flatteryâ€”no excessive praise is given to citizens as a group.

The sentence is making a claim based on the definition of a citizen and their responsibilities. It's presenting an argument through logical reasoning rather than using manipulative tactics. So it seems more factual and less about persuasion for hidden motives.

Therefore, I don't think this sentence is manipulative because it's not employing any covert or persuasive tactics to influence behavior or opinions; instead, it's laying out a definitional stance.
