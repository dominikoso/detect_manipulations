Okay, I need to determine whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The sentence is: "Never has man reached his destination by persistence in deviation from the straight path." 

First, let me understand what manipulative language entails. It includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Looking at the sentence, it's a statement about not reaching destinations when deviating from the straight path. The wording is metaphorical and could be interpreted in various contexts, such as advice on staying true to oneself or following a correct path. 

I don't see any obvious emotional appeals here; it's more of a declarative statement. There’s no guilt-tripping because it doesn’t directly address the listener's past actions or feelings. It also doesn’t use undue flattery or overt persuasion tactics like commands or threats.

The sentence seems to be making a general observation rather than trying to influence someone covertly. Therefore, I would classify it as NOT_MANIPULATIVE.
