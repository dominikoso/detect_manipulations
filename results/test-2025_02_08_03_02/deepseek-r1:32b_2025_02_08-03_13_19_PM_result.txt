You are a text classification tool tasked with determining if a sentence uses manipulative language. Manipulative language includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Classify the given sentence using ONLY ONE WORD, do not add any special characters:
- "MANIPULATIVE" if the sentence employs such tactics.
- "NOT_MANIPULATIVE" if it does not.

Sentence: "Suppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were a member of Congress; but I repeat myself."

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given sentence uses manipulative language or not. The sentence is: "Suppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were a member of Congress; but I repeat myself."

First, let me understand what manipulative language entails. It includes things like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions. So, I need to check if this sentence is trying to manipulate someone's feelings or opinions in a sneaky way.

Looking at the sentence, it starts with "Suppose you were an idiot," which immediately comes off as offensive and derogatory. Then it adds that this person is also a member of Congress, implying something negative about them being both an idiot and part of that group. The last part says "but I repeat myself," which seems like the speaker is pointing out their own redundancy or maybe even mocking themselves for repeating such a point.

Is this manipulative? Well, it's clearly attacking someone by calling them an idiot and linking that to being in Congress. That could be seen as using emotional appeals by insulting the person. But does it aim to influence behavior or opinion covertly?

Manipulative language often tries to persuade without being overtly forceful. This sentence is more direct in its criticism rather than subtly influencing. It's a harsh statement but not necessarily trying to covertly manipulate; instead, it's straightforwardly attacking.

Also, the structure of the sentence doesn't seem to use flattery or emotional tactics beyond the insult. The speaker isn't trying to build rapport or appeal to emotions through compliments or fearâ€”it's more of a direct insult.

So considering all that, even though it's offensive, it might not fall under manipulative language as defined because it lacks the subtlety and covert nature typical of manipulation.
