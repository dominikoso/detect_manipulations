You are a text classification tool tasked with determining if a sentence uses manipulative language. Manipulative language includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Classify the given sentence using ONLY ONE WORD, do not add any special characters:
- "MANIPULATIVE" if the sentence employs such tactics.
- "NOT_MANIPULATIVE" if it does not.

Sentence: "Everything about the left is perception, manipulation, and lies. Everything. Everything is 'Wag the Dog.' Everything is a structured deception."

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The task is clear: classify it as either "MANIPULATIVE" or "NOT_ MANIPULATIVE". 

First, let's read the sentence again carefully: "Everything about the left is perception, manipulation, and lies. Everything. Everything is 'Wag the Dog.' Everything is a structured deception." Hmm, this seems pretty strong. The speaker is making broad statements about the entire left being based on manipulation and lies.

Now, what counts as manipulative language? It includes emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or covert persuasion to influence behavior or opinions. In this sentence, I don't see any overtly emotional language, but it's using strong accusations against an entire group. By labeling everything about the left as manipulation and lies, the speaker is trying to sway the listener's opinion against that group.

The repetition of "Everything" emphasizes their point, making it seem like the left has no legitimate basisâ€”everything they do is just deception. Using phrases like "structured deception" and referencing a movie ("Wag the Dog") which is about manipulation adds to this narrative. This isn't just a straightforward argument; it's an attempt to color the listener's perception by framing the opposition in a negative light.

Is this manipulative? I think so because it's using strong, generalized statements to persuade rather than present facts. It's meant to influence others' opinions against the left without providing evidence, relying instead on pejorative labels.
