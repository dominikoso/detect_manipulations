Okay, I need to determine whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The sentence is "People never lie so much as after a hunt, during a war or before an election." 

First, let's understand what manipulative language entails. It includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Looking at the sentence, it seems to be making a general statement about when people lie more frequentlyâ€”after a hunt, during war, before an election. The structure is observational and doesn't directly appeal to emotions or use persuasive tactics. It's stating a fact without trying to influence the listener's actions or opinions in a manipulative way.

I don't see any emotional language here; it's more of a factual observation. There's no guilt-tripping involved, nor is there undue flattery. The sentence isn't trying to persuade someone into doing something or believing a certain way through covert means. Instead, it's pointing out times when people lie more, which could be seen as informative rather than manipulative.

So, considering these points, the sentence doesn't employ manipulative tactics. It simply states that lying increases in specific contexts without using persuasive language to influence behavior or opinions.
