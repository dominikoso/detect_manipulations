Okay, I need to figure out whether this sentence uses manipulative language. The sentence is: "The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary."

First, I should break down what the sentence is saying. It's talking about politics and how politicians might manipulate people's emotions. The author suggests that politics aims to keep people alarmed so they'll seek safety through leadership, using fear tactics—like "hobgoblins," which are imaginary threats.

I remember manipulative language often involves emotional appeals or creating fear to influence behavior. Here, the use of terms like "alarmed" and "clamorous to be led to safety" implies that people are being scared into following a certain path without necessarily understanding the real issues. The mention of "hobgoblins" as imaginary threats also points towards an attempt to instill unnecessary fear.

I should consider if this is just an observation or if it's meant to persuade. Since the sentence seems to critique politics by highlighting manipulation through fear, it might be more of a commentary rather than directly persuading someone. However, the tactic used—presenting an argument that suggests others are using manipulative tactics—could be seen as manipulative itself because it's trying to influence opinions about politics.

On one hand, if it's just stating facts without trying to persuade, it might not be manipulative. But on the other hand, by framing politicians' actions as fear-mongering, it could be aiming to sway people's views against certain political strategies, which would make it manipulative.

I'm leaning towards "MANIPULATIVE" because it uses loaded terms and a structure that implies agreement or critique meant to influence opinions. It's suggesting that politics relies on scaring the populace with made-up threats, which is a tactic aimed at persuading people about the nature of political strategies.
