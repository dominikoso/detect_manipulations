You are a text classification tool tasked with determining if a sentence uses manipulative language. Manipulative language includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Classify the given sentence using ONLY ONE WORD, do not add any special characters:
- "MANIPULATIVE" if the sentence employs such tactics.
- "NOT_MANIPULATIVE" if it does not.

Sentence: "What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant."

Alright, I need to determine whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The sentence is: "What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant."

First, I should break down the sentence to understand its components. It starts by talking about what's objectionable and dangerous about extremists, then contrasts it with the idea of being extreme versus being intolerant.

The structure here uses a comparative approach, pointing out that extremism itself isn't the main issue but rather the intolerance associated with it. The speaker is highlighting a specific aspect (intolerance) as the problematic behavior.

Now, to assess if this is manipulative, I have to consider if there are elements like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, or undue flattery. Emotional appeals would involve trying to stir feelings in the reader, but here the tone seems more analytical rather than emotionally charged.

Guilt-tripping typically involves making someone feel guilty for their actions or inactions. The sentence doesn't directly address the listener's behavior; it's a statement about extremists and their characteristics. So there's no attempt to make the listener feel guilt.

Undue flattery is another tactic, which would involve excessive praise to influence someone. This sentence isn't flattering anyone; it's more about pointing out negative traits of a group.

Covert persuasion aims to influence without being overt. The statement presents an argument but doesn't seem to have a hidden agenda or attempt to sway opinions through subtle means. It's making a point, but not in a manipulative way.

I should also consider the context. If this sentence is part of a larger discussion or debate, it might be used to steer the conversation towards a certain viewpoint. However, on its own, it's simply explaining why extremism is dangerous by focusing on intolerance rather than extremism itself.

Is there any persuasive tactic here? Maybe a bit of redefining terms (extremism vs. intolerance), but that doesn't necessarily make it manipulative unless it's being used to mislead or persuade in a sneaky way, which I don't think it is.

So, after considering all these points, the sentence seems informative and analytical rather than using manipulative tactics. Therefore, the classification should be "NOT_MANIPULATIVE."

The sentence presents an argument by contrasting two aspects of extremism but does not employ manipulative tactics like emotional appeals or guilt-tripping. It is analytical in nature.
