Alright, let's analyze this sentence step by step to determine if it uses manipulative language. The sentence is: "Political correctness to me is just intellectual terrorism. I find that really scary, and I won't be intimidated into changing my mind."

First, breaking down the components:

1. **"Political correctness to me is just intellectual terrorism."**
   - Here, political correctness (PC) is being compared to intellectual terrorism. This is a strong statement that uses hyperbole, which can be an emotional appeal. By labeling PC as terrorism, it's intended to evoke fear or strong emotions in the listener.

2. **"I find that really scary,"**
   - The use of "scary" directly expresses fear, which again is an emotional tactic. It aims to convey that the speaker feels threatened or scared by PC, possibly to persuade others to share this sentiment without providing evidence or balanced arguments.

3. **"and I won't be intimidated into changing my mind."**
   - This part suggests that the speaker is resistant to change and implies that others shouldn't be intimidated either. It uses a form of persuasion by positioning the speaker as someone who stands firm against pressure, possibly encouraging others to do the same without considering alternative viewpoints.

Considering these points, the sentence employs emotional appeals (using words like "scary" and "terrorism") and tries to persuade the listener to adopt or reinforce their stance without open dialogue. It uses strong language to influence opinions rather than engage in a balanced discussion.

The sentence uses strong emotional language and persuasion tactics to influence others, fitting the manipulative category.
