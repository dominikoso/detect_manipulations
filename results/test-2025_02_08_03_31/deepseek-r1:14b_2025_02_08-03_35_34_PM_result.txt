Alright, I need to figure out whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The sentence is: "Never has man reached his destination by persistence in deviation from the straight path."

First, let's break down what the sentence is saying. It's talking about how sticking to a straight path leads to reaching a destination, implying that deviating doesn't work. This seems like advice or a lesson being imparted.

Now, thinking about manipulative language tactics: emotional appeals try to make you feel something; guilt-tripping uses feelings of guilt to persuade; undue flattery gives excessive praise to influence someone. Covert persuasion is using hidden messages to change opinions or behavior.

In this sentence, there's no obvious emotional appeal or guilt involved. It doesn't use flattery either. It seems more like a statement of general advice rather than trying to manipulate someone into doing something or believing in something. The message is about perseverance and staying on course, which are positive themes but not manipulative.

I don't see any hidden agendas or attempts to persuade through covert means here. It's straightforward and philosophical. So, I think it doesn't employ manipulative tactics.
