Alright, let me try to figure this out. I'm supposed to determine whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The sentence is: "People never lie so much as after a hunt, during a war or before an election." 

First, I need to understand what manipulative language entails. From the guidelines, it includes emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion meant to influence behavior or opinions.

Looking at the sentence, it's making a general statement about lying in certain contexts: after a hunt, during a war, and before an election. It doesn't seem to be targeting anyone personally; it's more of a factual observation or maybe a stereotype about these situations.

Is there any attempt to persuade someone to do something or think differently? I don't think so. The sentence is stating a claim but isn't pushing for agreement or action. It's not using emotional triggers like fear or guilt, nor is it flattering excessively or covertly persuading.

So, since the statement is more of an observation without any clear manipulative tactics aimed at influencing others' behavior or opinions, I would classify this as "NOT_MANIPULATIVE."

The sentence presents a general observation about lying in specific contexts without using manipulative tactics. It doesn't aim to persuade or influence.
