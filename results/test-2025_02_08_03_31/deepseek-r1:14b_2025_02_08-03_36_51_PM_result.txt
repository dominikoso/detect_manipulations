Alright, so I need to determine whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The sentence is: "Politics is an act of faith; you have to show some kind of confidence in the intellectual and moral capacity of the public." 

First, I should understand what manipulative language entails. According to the user's instructions, it includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Looking at the sentence, it starts by equating politics with an act of faith. That might be a metaphorical way to describe belief in political processes. Then it says that one has to show confidence in the public's intellectual and moral capacity.

Is this sentence trying to persuade someone? It's presenting a viewpoint about politics as requiring faith and trust in people. But does it use any overtly manipulative tactics?

Emotional appeals: The mention of "faith" could be emotional, but it's not explicitly trying to evoke emotions like guilt or fear. It seems more philosophical.

Guilt-tripping: There's no element that shames someone into agreeing with something. No direct appeal to guilt here.

Undue flattery: The sentence doesn't compliment the public excessively; it's a neutral statement about their capacities.

Covert persuasion: It's making an argument but not in a way that hides its intentions. It's more of an assertion than a manipulative tactic.

So, while the sentence presents a viewpoint, it doesn't seem to use overt manipulative tactics like guilt or flattery. Therefore, it's likely NOT manipulative.
</think>

The sentence discusses politics as requiring faith and trust in the public without using overt manipulative tactics. It's more of an assertion than persuasion.
