Alright, I need to determine whether the sentence "Never go outside the experience of your people." uses manipulative language. Let me break this down step by step.

First, what defines manipulative language? It includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any form of covert persuasion aimed at influencing someone's behavior or opinions.

Looking at the sentence: "Never go outside the experience of your people." The speaker is advising against straying from established experiences. This could be interpreted as a cautionary statement, possibly emphasizing tradition or collective knowledge. 

I don't see any overt emotional appeals here; it's more of a directive than an emotional plea. There's no flattery involved eitherâ€”it's not complimenting someone. Also, there's no attempt to make the listener feel guilty for past actions or inactions.

The sentence seems to be a statement of advice based on experience rather than trying to manipulate through any of the mentioned tactics. It doesn't employ guilt or manipulation; it's more advisory.
