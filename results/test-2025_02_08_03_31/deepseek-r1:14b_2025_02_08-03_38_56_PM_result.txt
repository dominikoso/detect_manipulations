Alright, I need to determine if the given sentence is manipulative. The sentence is: "Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are."

First, I should recall what manipulative language entails. It includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any form of covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Looking at the sentence, it's making a statement about justice and outrage. The speaker is saying that justice isn't achieved until people who aren't directly affected feel as outraged as those who are. This seems to be an appeal for others to share the emotions of those affected, possibly to create a collective response.

The use of "outraged" is an emotional appeal, trying to stir feelings in the listeners or readers. The sentence might be aiming to persuade others to join in feeling outraged, which could influence their opinions or actions. This tactic is meant to sway people's emotions and perhaps lead them to take specific steps, like supporting a cause or change.

I don't see any elements of flattery or overt persuasion here; it's more about creating emotional共鸣 (resonance) to push for justice. However, the intent seems to be influencing others' feelings and actions, which fits under manipulative tactics.

Therefore, I would classify this sentence as "MANIPULATIVE."
