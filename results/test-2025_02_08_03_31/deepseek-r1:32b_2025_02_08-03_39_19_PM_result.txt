Okay, I need to determine whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The sentence is: "The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary."

First, let me break down what manipulative language entails. It includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Looking at the sentence, it describes a strategy where politicians keep people alarmed with imaginary threats ("hobgoblins") to make them clamor for safety and thus be led by those in power. This seems to imply that politicians are using fear tactics to control public opinion and behavior. By constantly presenting these imaginary threats, they create a sense of panic or urgency, which can manipulate the populace into supporting certain policies or leaders without fully understanding the reality.

The use of "menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins" suggests that the threats are not real but are used to instill fear. This tactic is meant to influence people's reactions and decisions, making them more susceptible to control. Therefore, this sentence describes a manipulative strategy aimed at persuading through fear rather than facts.

So, I would classify this as "MANIPULATIVE" because it involves using fear and continuous, imaginary threats to manipulate public behavior.
