Okay, so I need to determine whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The tools available are "MANIPULATIVE" or "NOT__MANIPULATIVE". 

First, let me understand what manipulative language entails. It includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Looking at the sentence: "What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant."

I should break it down. The speaker is talking about why extremists are problematic. They argue that the issue isn't their extremeness, but rather their intolerance. 

Is this trying to persuade someone? It seems more like a statement explaining a viewpoint. There's no emotional appeal or guilt-tripping here. It's presenting an argument that extremism itself isn't the problem, but the intolerance associated with it is.

So, does it manipulate by any means? I don't see emotional tactics; it's more of a logical point. The speaker is clarifying their stance without using flattery or coercion.
