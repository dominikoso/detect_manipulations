You are a text classification tool tasked with determining if a sentence uses manipulative language. Manipulative language includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions.

Classify the given sentence using ONLY ONE WORD, do not add any special characters:
- "MANIPULATIVE" if the sentence employs such tactics.
- "NOT_MANIPULATIVE" if it does not.

Sentence: "Suppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were a member of Congress; but I repeat myself."

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the given sentence uses manipulative language. The sentence is: "Suppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were a member of Congress; but I repeat myself."

First, let's break down what manipulative language entails. It includes tactics like emotional appeals, guilt-tripping, undue flattery, or any covert persuasion aimed at influencing behavior or opinions. So, the question is whether this sentence employs any of those techniques.

Looking at the sentence, it starts with "Suppose you were an idiot," which immediately comes off as offensive. Calling someone an idiot directly attacks their intelligence and could be seen as a form of insult rather than flattery. Then it adds, "and suppose you were a member of Congress; but I repeat myself." The second part is redundant because if someone is a member of Congress, they are already assumed to be a person in power, so the statement seems repetitive or perhaps even mocking.

So, is this manipulative? Well, manipulative language often tries to influence through subtler means. Here, it's more direct and insulting. It doesn't seem to be using flattery or emotional appeal but rather mockery and insult. The speaker isn't trying to persuade through charm or emotional tactics; instead, they're being confrontational.

Therefore, I don't think this sentence uses manipulative language as defined because it's more about insult than persuasion.
